                    Here's a bio. This is where you talk about bio related things.
                    Like life and music and whatever. I didn't really have a plan
                    here. Not sure when to stop talking. These are just the lines
                    management gave me. Hey management! What are my lines again.
                    Damnit man! We went over this so much. You had one job. Your
                    job was to say your lines. Our job was to give you the lines.
                    And look what you haven't done! Well come on I'm famous I've
                    got so many better things to be doing than sitting here and 
                    look what you got me doing. A dumb commercial for a dumb app.
                    I mean the color scheme looks like something out of some Disney
                    movie. Well fine then maybe we just won't pay you. Well then
                    I'm not gonna recite your dumb lines for your dumb app. You
                    little...(reception lost)
